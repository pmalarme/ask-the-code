# Ask The Code - Frontend

To run the frontend, you need to:

1. Install the dependencies using `npm install`
2. Setup the code bases in `src\config.json`
    
    * `code_bases`: a JSON array of code bases name that are mapped to index name in the backend.
    * `code_bases_label`: a JSON object with the code base name as key and the code base label as value. This code base label is used to display the code base name in the UI.

3. Run the frontend using `npm start`
